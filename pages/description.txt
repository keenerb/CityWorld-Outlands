== **CityWorld** ==
The great outdoors is all fine and good but sometimes you just want to go to town. 
Not any town will do, how about one that goes on forever or multiple ones separated by the largest mountains possible in MineCraft. 
But what is under those mountains? 
There is an entire world to explore, have fun!

v3.002
* Now supports Minecraft/Spigot 1.9 (or I think it does) and was tested against PI day build of Spigot
* Added an option to turn off things like Hot Air Balloons for folks who don't like fun things in the air ;-)
* Add material lists for astral, bunkers and water towers generation, yes I know there still more to do
* Reduced the likelihood of Museums, sorry about that
* Farms now can grow BeetRoots, Yumm!
* More building and roof styles
* MAYBE ISSUE: It seems to me that Minecraft/Spigot 1.9 causes CityWorld to generate worlds slower, but I could be wrong
* Fixed bugs

v3.001
* Finally got the fossils generating... and Museums :-)
* Fixed a long standing tree generation bug... and added the occasional dead tree trunk

v3.000
* The majority of materials used during building generation are now configurable (lists are maintained in the cityworld's yml file)
* All chest content generation is now configurable (phatloot should still work if you really need it)
* Road material is now configurable, don't like clay... change it
* Added new lot types to world (hot air balloons, water towers, park mazes, barns, etc.)
* Brought over some of the Maze world lots to normal worlds (lumber yards, quarries, camp grounds, etc.) 
* Created a way to invert the range generation logic, now you can generate cities that surround a center of nature instead of the other way around
* Lots of refactoring and tweaking, world generation will likely change... sorry but it couldn't be helped
* Fixed a number of bugs that have been bothering me

([[http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/cityworld/pages/version/|For older version info...]]

Remember, if you aren't up for using the latest beta of Bukkit or the bugs from this one bother you too much, the older versions are still available.

** Personal note **

It has been a while, sorry but my day job continues to be a bit crazy and is pretty much taking up all of my time. 
<<color red>>With the upcoming changes in 1.8, it is VERY possible that CityWorld will have to be rewritten quite a bit. I have taken the first step with this latest release, but there is still much that can happen. Only time will tell. <</color>>

=== Heads up! ===

This plugin really "tests" MineCraft/Bukkit when it comes to complex worlds. 
In fact when you spawn/teleport into a new CityWorld (or some wildly new location) it takes a while for all of the blocks to generate. 
This is especially obvious if you are flying around. 
Once the blocks are generated though everything works just fine. 
What I recommend is take a tour of your new world and just walk/fly up to each "uninitialized chunk" until everything shows up.
