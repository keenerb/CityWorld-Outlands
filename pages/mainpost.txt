== **CityWorld** ==
The great outdoors is all good and fine but sometimes you just want to go to town. 
Not any town will do, how about one that goes on forever or multiple ones separated by the largest mountains possible in MineCraft. 
But what is under those mountains? 
There is an entire world to explore, have fun!

v3.011
Removed the Enchanting Tables from libraries (meant to get earlier but forgot to)
Fixed a few glitches in decayed and nether worlds (farms didn't get destroyed, too much water not enough lava, etc.)
Changed the paths in parks and buried logs in farms with Grass Paths (what good are new materials if I never use them)
Fixed mobs spawning on oil rigs and hot air balloons
Enemy generation is now more controllable via SpawnEnemy percentage option
Reeds are back near the shores, they disappeared about a year ago, like roundabouts - sigh, I wonder what else has gone missing
Fixed up some fluid generation issues (generalized version of the above nether world fix)
Enhanced Parks a bit more and made country roads a bit more country-ish
Made things camouflage better in the mountains
More corner styles, because why not :-)
Made buddy, animal, enemy and spawn lists configurable, keep in mind these lists can only contain living entities right now
Renamed a few settings to make mob spawning more controllable
Tweaked the factory big chimney's height a bit, now they aren't quite a tall
Minecraft (as of 1.9.4) and Spigot (as of 5/20) happy 

v3.010
Fixed a code error that goofed up generation range limits 

v3.009
Finally added villagers (in houses) and animal spawning (in farms)
Finally added stuff to concrete lots, think urban non-parks parks
Fixed a glitch that prevented grass and flowers in certain lots that should have had them
More roof styles
More default wall & ceiling material for buildings
More vat & pit materials in factories
Minecraft (as of 1.9.2) and Spigot (as of 5/2) happy 

And before that
Fixed a bug where factory skywalk supports would go too far up in a destroyed world
Refactored the corner of building code to make it much easier to maintain 
Made it so that external doors in buildings don't get covered up anymore
Fixed some destroyed and factory building issues
Added METRO to easy world styles
Whole lot more styles of buildings (more balconies, corners, roofs, indents, etc.)
Roundabouts are back, they disappeared about 2 to 3 years ago... why didn't anyone (including me) notice?
Fixed up bunkers, campgrounds and oil rig platforms
Made the highrises even higher
Touched up roads, man holes and made the sewers slightly crazier
Fixed an issue that prevented Hotair balloons from being found out in the wild
Added factories (of a sort) to the industrial areas
Added NATURE to the easy world styles
Cranes now render correctly in 1.9 again, Mojang changed how Iron Fences rendered
Unfinished buildings now follow similar rules to normal buildings
Even more styles of buildings, woot! 
And a few Paddocks
Fixed a bug in Woodframe lots that would sometimes cause exceptions
Now supports Minecraft/Spigot 1.9 (or I think it does) and was tested against PI day build of Spigot
Added an option to turn off things like Hot Air Balloons for folks who don't like fun things in the air ;-)
Add material lists for astral, bunkers and water towers generation, yes I know there still more to do
Reduced the likelihood of Museums, sorry about that
Farms now can grow BeetRoots, Yumm!
More building and roof styles
MAYBE ISSUE: It seems to me that Minecraft/Spigot 1.9 causes CityWorld to generate worlds slower, but I could be wrong
Finally got the fossils generating... and Museums :-)
Fixed a long standing tree generation bug... and added the occasional dead tree trunk
The majority of materials used during building generation are now configurable (lists are maintained in the cityworld's yml file)
All chest content generation is now configurable (phatloot should still work if you really need it)
Road material is now configurable, don't like clay... change it
Added new lot types to world (hot air balloons, water towers, park mazes, barns, etc.)
Brought over some of the Maze world lots to normal worlds (lumber yards, quarries, camp grounds, etc.) 
Created a way to invert the range generation logic, now you can generate cities that surround a center of nature instead of the other way around
Lots of refactoring and tweaking, world generation will likely change... sorry but it couldn't be helped
Fixed a number of bugs that have been bothering me

** Personal note **

It has been a while, sorry but my day job continues to be a bit crazy and is pretty much taking up all of my time. In this most recent update CityWorld should now work against 1.8.8 to a large degree. Many things have changed with the latest MineCraft and Spigot/CraftBukkit, I would be surprised if no problems are hiding in here somewhere.

=== Heads up! ===

This plugin really "tests" MineCraft/Bukkit when it comes to complex worlds. 
In fact when you spawn/teleport into a new CityWorld (or some wildly new location) it takes a while for all of the blocks to generate. 
This is especially obvious if you are flying around. 
Once the blocks are generated though everything works just fine. 
What I recommend is take a tour of your new world and just walk/fly up to each "uninitialized chunk" until everything shows up.
